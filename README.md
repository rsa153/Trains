# Trains
### About
 This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. When adding trains, administrators are able to submit the following information: Train Name, Destination, First Train Time (in military time), and Frequency (in minutes). This app will calculate when the next train will arrive relative to the current time. Users from different machines can view the same train times.
